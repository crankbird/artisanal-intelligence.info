<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Predicting future outcomes is crucial in the ever-evolving landscape of
technology and market trends. Traditional models often fail to provide
predictive value, especially during rapid change. The Magic Roundabout™
schematic is designed to address this need by providing a comprehensive
visual tool for analysing and predicting technology and market trends.</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>

<p>Creating accurate models to predict technology and market trends is
inherently difficult, mainly when trends are in a state of flux. Leaders
need tools that offer insights into hidden patterns and biases, enabling
them to make informed decisions and motivate action.</p>

<p><strong>Existing Tools</strong></p>

<p>While traditional tools like SWOT analysis and the Gartner Hype Cycle
are helpful, they often reinforce existing biases and fail to provide a
broad perspective. The Magic Roundabout schematic overcomes these
limitations by integrating multiple analytical frameworks.</p>

<p><strong>A New Perspective</strong></p>

<p>The Magic Roundabout™ schematic was developed to help organisations
recognise and adapt to significant technical and market shifts, such as
the growing importance of sustainability in IT purchase decisions. By
enabling the analysis of various factors that might not be typically
included in a tech trend or market analysis, including political,
economic, and ethical dimensions, this tool helps identify and address
cognitive biases, blind spots, and where marketing rhetoric is
disconnected from business development and market priorities.</p>

<p><strong>Categorization and Watchlist Items</strong></p>

<p>The schematic uses a range of categories to analyse the forces impacting
a business. Methodologies such as Porter’s Five Forces, PEST, and the
MECE principle can all be integrated to provide a holistic view. For
example, a PESTLE analysis can reveal the impact of disruptive changes
across different categories, helping organisations like NetApp to
challenge long-held assumptions.</p>

<p>Unlike other two-dimensional systems of visualising data, each
identified trend (watchlist item) can be a member of multiple
categories, each having a level of impact or horizon unique to that
category. This allows for a multi-dimensional analysis of the data while
still preserving a simple and visually appealing representation of the
dataset that can be constructed with widely available toolsets such as
Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p><strong>Measuring Impact</strong></p>

<p>To assess the relative importance of different factors, the construction
of the Magic Roundabout schematic allows for the use of any quantitative
scale, including hard financial data or other well-understood metrics
applicable across the problem domain or source dataset. In the absence
of an objective metric, we recommend a five-point scale to measure
opinions relating to impact or importance. This qualitative metric
ensures that speculative data is treated with appropriate caution while
maintaining transparency in assumptions.</p>

<p>The five-point scale could be structured as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Very Low Impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low Impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medium Impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High Impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very High Impact</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This approach can harmonise data from existing analyst reports,
providing an intuitive and easily understood way of creating quality
from a set of quantity ranges or a quantifiable metric from a purely
qualitative estimate. This qualitative metric ensures that speculative
data is treated with appropriate caution while maintaining transparency
in assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>Time Horizons</strong></p>

<p>Predicting time to impact or exactly when a technology is likely to be
impactful is at best uncertain with the negative consequences of being
too early to market being as great, if not greater than being late,
which at least has the potential advantage of leveraging the fast
follower model. Trends also tend to follow an s-curve adoption which
makes adoption and time impact at an organisational and market subset
highly dependent on the ability to adapt to change.</p>

2013" /></p>

<p>As a result, the schematic also incorporates McKinsey’s Three Horizons
model to determine the level of investment and management approach
needed for different trends.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future-with-the-magic-roundabout/media/media/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Rather than focusing on timelines, the McKinsey model helps
organizations prepare for future impacts by focusing on the kinds of
leadership actions should be taken today. This horizon model also maps
neatly onto the Gartner “Transform, Grow, Run” model.</p>

<p>To aid in identification of which horizon a given trend (watchlist item)
falls into, the respondent can be asked “what do you know about this
trend”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“I have comprehensive knowledge / this is part of my core business”
= “Known Knowns” = Horizon 1 / Run</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“I know enough to extract significant value, but there’s still
things I need to get a handle on” = “Known Unknowns” = Horizon 2 /
Grow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“I know enough to be dangerous” = “Unknown Unknowns” = Horizon 3 /
Transform</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While a three horizon model provides simplicity and power, the magic
roundabout could also accommodate other time based segmentation across
more than three categories such as Current Quarter, Current Year, Next
year, 2+ years, 5+ years, however unless there was sufficient rigor in
the predictions against these timeframes, they could easily lead to a
false sense of security that nothing needs to be done, or that dealing
with that will be someone else’s problem by the time it becomes
important at which point it may be too late to execute even a fast
follower strategy.</p>

<p><strong>The Magic Roundabout Schematic</strong></p>

<p>The Magic Roundabout™ schematic combines these categories, watchlist
items, impact scores, and time horizons into a visually appealing
sunburst diagram. This tool is available to every user of the Microsoft
Office suite and can be easily adapted to various needs.</p>

<p><strong>Example Dataset</strong></p>

<p>A simplified Excel spreadsheet table is used to create the schematic:</p>

<p>By comparing the two graphics it becomes immediately apparent that
cybersecurity and future threats are perceived by the second persona as
far more impactful overall than cloud and consumption based economic
models. By averaging these scores across different personas, companies
and market segments, trends can be identified that differ across
geographies and job roles, allowing for a more tailored go-to-market
response.</p>

<p>This methodology has also been used with more objective information to
perform an analysis of total addressable market categorised by NetApp’s
go to market priorities which surfaced up some unexpected insights as
seen in the following graphic.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future-with-the-magic-roundabout/media/media/image6.emf" alt="" /></p>

<p>The resulting diagrams provides a clear visualization of trends and
their relative importance, helping organizations navigate the
complexities of market dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The Magic Roundabout™ schematic is a powerful tool for business
consulting in the field of technology. By offering a comprehensive,
visual method for analyzing market trends, it enables better
decision-making and strategic planning.</p>]]></content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><category term="[&quot;category1&quot;, &quot;category2&quot;]" /><category term="tag1" /><category term="tag2" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visualising the Future with the Magic Roundabout™ Schematic]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/visualising-the-future-with-the-magic-roundabout/media/media/image1.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/visualising-the-future-with-the-magic-roundabout/media/media/image1.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">visualising-the-future</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/category1/category2/2025/04/14/visualising-the-future.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="visualising-the-future" /><published>2025-04-14T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2025-04-14T00:00:00+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/category1/category2/2025/04/14/visualising-the-future</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/category1/category2/2025/04/14/visualising-the-future.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="visualising-the-future">Visualising the future.</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>I remember my first economics lesson at university, where we were given
a selection of economic theories and models and asked to judge which
ones were the most useful. Some were just plain wrong, but after
eliminating those, there were two left—one that fit the data beautifully
and another that was vague. Naturally, I chose the elegant one, and
naturally, I was wrong because while it explained what happened in the
past, it had no predictive value. The vague and messy theory that
provided at least a partial way of predicting an outcome given a single
variable, was the correct answer.</p>

<p>Creating these kinds of models is difficult at the best of times, but it
becomes even more so when many of the trends that used to be stable, or
at least linear, now seem to be in a chaotic state of flux.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to lead people by highlighting the dangers of
maintaining the status quo for too long or paint a bright future that
motivates them to take new action. In that case, you must be able to
give people insight into trends and patterns they may not be able to see
while they are fighting in the trenches. You need to be able to shine a
light on your blind spots and cognitive biases and find an
easy-to-understand tool that helps to both understand the world around
you and to help you share those insights with others.</p>

<h2 id="some-existing-tools">Some Existing Tools</h2>

<p>These kinds of tools have been around for a while. Some, like the SWOT
diagram, are known and have been used by almost everyone. They’re a good
tool, but often, they don’t give us the best idea about exactly where
and when we should put in our efforts. One of my favourite critiques of
the SWOT analysis comes from Simon Wardley in his blog Bits or Pieces,
where he makes a case for maps vs diagrams.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image1.png" alt="" /><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We also have access to well-known diagrams like the Gartner hype cycle
or the technology diffusion curve that assume new things are adopted in
an almost universal pattern, with adoption rates being the only
variable.</p>

<p>These are all useful, but from my experience, they reinforce our
prejudices and cognitive biases, leaving us open to disruption that
could have been predicted and exploited if we had taken a broader view.</p>

<h2 id="finding-new-perspectives">Finding new perspectives</h2>

<p>One example for NetApp was what some think of as our “just-in-time”
recognition of the importance of sustainability at a corporate level.
The technology evangelism and market strategy team were tasked with
discovering how we almost missed it and how to identify and take
advantage of upcoming changes to customer perceptions and buying
criteria.</p>

<p>Our analysis found a range of reasons why, as an organisation, we
developed a blind spot to the importance of ESG for IT purchase
decisions instead of primarily investor relations and how other vendors
like Pure managed to grab a head start. The simplified explanation is
that NetApp released its inaugural ESG report when energy prices
worldwide were at the end of a decade-long decline. In contrast, Pure
released theirs when power prices in Europe and Japan had increased by a
factor of eight in six months.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image3.png" alt="A graph of a graph showing the growth of the past year Description
automatically generated with medium
confidence" /></p>

<p>We were probably insensitive to the changes in power prices outside of
the US because research from McKinsey in 2020 said that improving
operational efficiency and reducing costs was one of the least impactful
aspects of ESG and had significantly decreased in importance over the
prior decade.</p>

<p>Pure was more lucky than good in their ESG timing. However, NetApp also
could have beaten them to the punch if we hadn’t still been working on
assumptions that remained unchallenged even after the disruptive nature
of the transition in the US presidency on January 6<sup>th</sup> and
Russia’s subsequent invasion of Ukraine. Both changed the entire energy
and regulatory landscape. Yet, because NetApp lacked a way of looking
more broadly at all the forces that impact our stakeholders’
livelihoods, we allowed our competitors to seize the initiative.</p>

<h2 id="categorisation">Categorisation</h2>

<p>Several frameworks and tools can be used to avoid these kinds of blind
spots by looking at a business and the forces that surround it across a
range of different categories. Methodologies, including Porter’s five
forces, PEST, VRIO, and the MECE principle, focus on a discrete set of
categories through which to view the problem domain, each one of which
has its strengths and weaknesses. For the sustainability challenge, a
PEST / PESTLE / STEEPLE analysis would have likely given NetApp the
perspective it needed to challenge long-held assumptions or to map the
impact of disruptive change across environmental, political, and
regulatory groupings. as a level of impact as shown in the following
example from <a href="https://www.business-to-you.com/product/pestel-analysis-powerpoint/">PESTEL Analysis PowerPoint - B2U -
Business-to-you.com</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image4.png" alt="A chart with colorful lines and text Description automatically
generated" /></p>

<p>There is nothing intrinsically necessary or authoritative about those
categories. The PESTEL framework evolved from a simpler breakdown called
PEST and has since evolved to STEEPLE or TELOS category sets, all of
which are valid and all of which are arguable. Categories evolve, and
each set needs to be fit for purpose.</p>

<p>There isn’t any “right” way to categorise the issues in a particular
problem domain, and having multiple ways of categorising them is
probably to look at the problem from different perspectives is perhaps
better than agonising trying to find the one irrefutable truth. The
“Truth” is often interconnected in strange ways, more like the messy
hidden rhizome beneath a mushroom than a neat branching of trees of
knowledge and trying to impose order on it can sometimes lead to
analysis paralysis if not outright madness.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image5.jpeg" alt="wi F" /></p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-look-for">What do we look for?</h2>

<p>With the right kind of categorisation, we can now ask the right
questions. What types of things within these categories will likely
impact us and our stakeholders? Let’s call them “watchlist items”. In
the PESTEL diagram above, we see not only the categories but also one or
more specific areas of interest inside each category, along with a rough
measure of the impact that will have. Using the example of
sustainability as a buying criterion, we might have identified the
following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Political –</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Sanctions against Russia</p>

of hindsight, but two findings should be clear from that list.</p>

<p>The first finding is that heightened concerns over energy infrastructure
and cybersecurity could have been identified as early as February 2021.
The second finding is that some of the identified watchlist items could
belong to multiple categories. For example, is the shutdown of nuclear
power a technical, economic, or ethical issue? It could easily be argued
that it belongs in all three and that the connections between the
categories and the watchlist items aren’t the superficial kind of
hierarchical taxonomy that we have come to depend on to structure our
knowledge since the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to avoid descending into fruitless arguments about which
category a watchlist item belongs in. In that case, our analysis tool
needs to provide a way for these to live in a kind of quantum
superposition by simultaneously existing in many different categories.</p>

<p>In some cases, categorisation and watchlist creation may uncover new
items of interest that don’t fit our chosen categories. This is a
perfectly acceptable outcome because it allows us to start at the top
with categories and work our way down to watchlist items, or conversely,
start with things we are interested in and see what categories evolve
from that and how well we have distributed our current thinking across
all areas of concern.</p>

<p>This should alert us to areas of under or over-investment and potential
blind spots.</p>

<p>##</p>

<h2 id="measuring-impact">Measuring Impact</h2>

<p>Along with identifying the categories you use to derive insight and to
help identify watchlist items within those categories, we need some way
of determining the relative importance or impact each one of these items
will have. The PESTEL diagram above uses a straightforward low, medium,
and high impact, which is the least granular scale you can use
effectively. At the other end of the scale are percentages or absolute
revenue measures to the nearest cent, but these measures often hide the
bigger truth.</p>

<p>Though I’m often in awe of our business planners when we announce our
earnings and our revenue projections, for many of the things we are
trying to predict, we don’t have the backing data or the experience
needed to predict things with that level of confidence. The future can’t
be predicted to the last decimal place, and we risk only analysing what
can be measured, which leads to a kind of McNamara fallacy. If you’ve
never heard of it, perhaps this quote will give you an idea of how
dangerous it can be</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. The
second step is to disregard that which can’t easily be measured or
given a quantitative value. The third step is to presume that what
can’t be easily measured isn’t essential. The fourth step is to say
that what can’t be easily measured really doesn’t exist. This is
suicide. “</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Yankelovich">Daniel
Yankelovich</a>,
“Interpreting the New Life Styles”, Sales
Management (1971)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy#cite_note-2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other problem is that when granular metrics are available, it is
often difficult for people without subject matter expertise to give
those metrics adequate context. For example, if I say an email campaign
resulted in a 0.3% open rate, can a non-marketing person tell me if
that’s good or bad? Or if an analyst says that a given market has
sales growth of 13%, can you say if that’s high or low growth without
knowing how big or mature that market is?</p>

<p>In many cases, we are dealing with systems with many “unknown unknowns,”
and assigning specific growth rates, percentages, total addressable
market sizes, or penetration figures creates a false sense of accuracy.</p>

<p>To resolve this, we need to look at analyst methods like the Gartner
Hype Cycle, Wardley Maps, and Technology Diffusion curves, where we see
repeatedly five-stage or five-scale systems appear. In some cases, it’s
possible to map differently named stages directly against each other.
For example, the Slope of Enlightenment and the early majority are both
stage 4 on each of these fixed adoption curve analyses.</p>

<p>This five-point scale gives us some good opportunities to harmonise and
validly compare data from various kinds of analysis. It also provides an
intuitive and easily understood way of creating quality from a set of
quantity ranges or a quantifiable metric from a purely qualitative
estimate.</p>

<p>Given the uncertain nature of the data, using a qualitative metric like
this keeps us mindful of its speculative nature. At the same time,
explicitly recording our assumptions about what “high” or
“transformative” means in our narratives keeps us honest and
transparent in using qualitative terms between ourselves and in our
marketing and other narratives.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-time">Measuring Time</h2>

<p>The final element in this is the question of time and what actions we
should be taking now to prepare for the things we have identified as
being essential to us. This is the most crucial question of all and the
most challenging question to answer. Almost anyone can see that the
stock market, along with sporadic booms and busts, will go up over time.
If you’re patient, you can make good progress, but if you knew precisely
what days it would be up or down with exact certainty, you could become
the wealthiest person in the world. Being too early into the market is
often as bad as being too late. Trying to predict precisely when a given
trend will have a specific impact requires a level of information and
predictability that most futurists don’t have. As mentioned earlier, our
financial team’s ability to predict NetApp’s financial metrics three
months to a year out seems nearly magic. However, even that still
doesn’t answer the most critical question.</p>

<p>What should I be doing about this future impact today?</p>

<p>One of the best ways of answering this comes from McKinsey via their
“Three Horizons” model.</p>

<p>This framework isn’t new; indeed, the best explanation can be found in
an article entitled Enduring Ideas: The three horizons of growth |
McKinsey. It assumes that adoption follows a series of “S-curves,” which
maps well to the technology adoption model.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image7.png" alt="" /><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image8.jpeg" alt="Discerning
Rejection of Technology - Sudhir Rama Murthy, Monto Mani,
2013" /></p>

<p>It also maps well to Gartner’s Transform, Grow, Run model. The things in
Horizon One are well known or are dominated by “known knowns”; the
business depends on their existence, and the focus is to run them at
scale with the greatest efficiency. On a Wardley map, this corresponds
to the utility stage of development. This is the realm of superior
execution and management excellence. At the other end of the scale is
Horizon 3, where things are the least well-known, with “unknown
unknowns”, and the risks of guessing wrong are high, along with the
rewards from making the right moves early. This is the place where
vision, enthusiasm, and evangelism thrive. It is also where leadership
has the most significant transformational impact.</p>

<p>In the middle is horizon 2, which takes the successful efforts of the
high-risk horizon three efforts and confers positional advantage. I
characterise this as the “known unknowns” stage. This is where
aggressive entrepreneurship, growth mindsets, and flexible budgets rule.</p>

<p>As noted in the article</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Time, as noted on the x-axis, should not be interpreted as a prompt
for when to pay attention—now, later, or much later. Companies must
manage businesses along all three horizons concurrently.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than trying to guess exactly when a watchlist item will create an
impact, using the three horizons model focuses on what level of
investment is warranted and what kind of management and leadership
approach is needed to address that item today to prepare ourselves for
what may happen in the future.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-it-all-together--the-magic-roundabout">Bringing it all together – The Magic Roundabout</h2>

<p>Now that we have all of these requirements clarified, how can we create
a tool that effectively and visually pleasingly communicates all of
these with the data we already have or can be gathered easily using
commonly available tools with minimal need for enablement?</p>

<p>The answer is “The Magic Roundabout”. This combines categories,
watchlist items, impact scores, and McKinsey Horizons into a “Sunburst”
diagram available to every user of the Microsoft Office suite of
products. The underlying dataset is an elementary Excel spreadsheet
table that looks like this.</p>

<p>Which results in a diagram that looks like this</p>

<p>However, a more complex example shows how this can be extended or
adapted to accommodate some of the requirements that were brought up
earlier, including the need for a watchlist item to belong to multiple
categories. It also provides for things not previously addressed, such
as tracking technology that is currently on horizon one but evolving
rapidly due to changes and technical disruptions.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While the radial nature of the sunburst diagram clearly shows the trend
and horizons and, based on early prototyping, is the most visually
appealing way of representing our data, like a Mercator projection, it
does tend to distort the relative importance of watchlist items towards
the edges of the map. This can be addressed by using the complementary
treemap diagram, which uses exactly the same dataset.</p>

<p>This is clearer to read and preserves the relative overall importance at
the expense of navigating the trends over time.</p>]]></content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><category term="[&quot;category1&quot;, &quot;category2&quot;]" /><category term="tag1" /><category term="tag2" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visualising the future.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image1.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/visualising-the-future/media/media/image1.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Artisanal Intelligence</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/10/welcome-to-artisanal-intelligence.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Artisanal Intelligence" /><published>2025-04-10T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2025-04-10T00:00:00+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/04/10/welcome-to-artisanal-intelligence</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/10/welcome-to-artisanal-intelligence.html"><![CDATA[<hr />

<h1 id="welcome-to-artisanal-intelligence">Welcome to <em>Artisanal Intelligence</em></h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A place where technology meets intentionality, and code meets craft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern artificial intelligence often feels like mass production — sprawling neural networks, industrial-scale data centers, and opaque algorithms trained on oceans of data. But <em>what if intelligence could be artisanal</em>?</p>

<h2 id="-what-do-we-mean-by-artisanal">🧠 What Do We Mean by “Artisanal”?</h2>

<p>The term <em>artisanal</em> might evoke images of sourdough bread, handmade furniture, or carefully roasted coffee. But in the context of AI, it suggests something more subtle: <strong>a human-centered, intentional approach to building and understanding intelligence.</strong></p>

<h3 id="why-artisanal-and-not-artificial">Why “Artisanal” and Not “Artificial”?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Artisanal intelligence is curated.</strong> Instead of training models on everything, we might train them on <em>something</em> — something meaningful, contextual, or intentionally chosen.</li>
  <li><strong>It values transparency.</strong> Like watching a baker knead dough, we believe in models that you can understand and even <em>tinker with</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s designed for collaboration.</strong> Not to replace people, but to augment them. To partner with them. To amplify judgment, not override it.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="️-tools-not-gods">🛠️ Tools, Not Gods</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The best tools don’t make decisions for you. They help you think better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many modern AI systems are black boxes. Artisanal Intelligence seeks the opposite: <strong>white boxes that support clarity.</strong> We believe that design matters. That a well-structured prompt is as important as the model that reads it. That <em>interface is part of intelligence</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s what that might look like in practice:</p>
