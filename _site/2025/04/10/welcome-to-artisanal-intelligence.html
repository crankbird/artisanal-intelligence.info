<h1 id="welcome-to-artisanal-intelligence">Welcome to <em>Artisanal Intelligence</em></h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A place where technology meets intentionality, and code meets craft.</p>

<p>Modern artificial intelligence often feels like mass production — sprawling neural networks, industrial-scale data centers, and opaque algorithms trained on oceans of data. But <em>what if intelligence could be artisanal</em>?</p>

<h2 id="-what-do-we-mean-by-artisanal">🧠 What Do We Mean by “Artisanal”?</h2>

<p>The term <em>artisanal</em> might evoke images of sourdough bread, handmade furniture, or carefully roasted coffee. But in the context of AI, it suggests something more subtle: <strong>a human-centered, intentional approach to building and understanding intelligence.</strong></p>

<h3 id="why-artisanal-and-not-artificial">Why “Artisanal” and Not “Artificial”?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Artisanal intelligence is curated.</strong> Instead of training models on everything, we might train them on <em>something</em> — something meaningful, contextual, or intentionally chosen.</li>
  <li><strong>It values transparency.</strong> Like watching a baker knead dough, we believe in models that you can understand and even <em>tinker with</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s designed for collaboration.</strong> Not to replace people, but to augment them. To partner with them. To amplify judgment, not override it.</li>
</ul>

  <p>“The best tools don’t make decisions for you. They help you think better.”</p>

<p>Many modern AI systems are black boxes. Artisanal Intelligence seeks the opposite: <strong>white boxes that support clarity.</strong> We believe that design matters. That a well-structured prompt is as important as the model that reads it. That <em>interface is part of intelligence</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s what that might look like in practice:</p>
