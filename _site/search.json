    "content": "Visualising the future.IntroI remember my first economics lesson at university, where we were givena selection of economic theories and models and asked to judge whichones were the most useful. Some were just plain wrong, but aftereliminating those, there were two left—one that fit the data beautifullyand another that was vague. Naturally, I chose the elegant one, andnaturally, I was wrong because while it explained what happened in thepast, it had no predictive value. The vague and messy theory thatprovided at least a partial way of predicting an outcome given a singlevariable, was the correct answer.Creating these kinds of models is difficult at the best of times, but itbecomes even more so when many of the trends that used to be stable, orat least linear, now seem to be in a chaotic state of flux.Suppose you want to lead people by highlighting the dangers ofmaintaining the status quo for too long or paint a bright future thatmotivates them to take new action. In that case, you must be able togive people insight into trends and patterns they may not be able to seewhile they are fighting in the trenches. You need to be able to shine alight on your blind spots and cognitive biases and find aneasy-to-understand tool that helps to both understand the world aroundyou and to help you share those insights with others.Some Existing ToolsThese kinds of tools have been around for a while. Some, like the SWOTdiagram, are known and have been used by almost everyone. They’re a goodtool, but often, they don’t give us the best idea about exactly whereand when we should put in our efforts. One of my favourite critiques ofthe SWOT analysis comes from Simon Wardley in his blog Bits or Pieces,where he makes a case for maps vs diagrams.We also have access to well-known diagrams like the Gartner hype cycleor the technology diffusion curve that assume new things are adopted inan almost universal pattern, with adoption rates being the onlyvariable.These are all useful, but from my experience, they reinforce ourprejudices and cognitive biases, leaving us open to disruption thatcould have been predicted and exploited if we had taken a broader view.Finding new perspectivesOne example for NetApp was what some think of as our “just-in-time”recognition of the importance of sustainability at a corporate level.The technology evangelism and market strategy team were tasked withdiscovering how we almost missed it and how to identify and takeadvantage of upcoming changes to customer perceptions and buyingcriteria.Our analysis found a range of reasons why, as an organisation, wedeveloped a blind spot to the importance of ESG for IT purchasedecisions instead of primarily investor relations and how other vendorslike Pure managed to grab a head start. The simplified explanation isthat NetApp released its inaugural ESG report when energy pricesworldwide were at the end of a decade-long decline. In contrast, Purereleased theirs when power prices in Europe and Japan had increased by afactor of eight in six months.We were probably insensitive to the changes in power prices outside ofthe US because research from McKinsey in 2020 said that improvingoperational efficiency and reducing costs was one of the least impactfulaspects of ESG and had significantly decreased in importance over theprior decade.Pure was more lucky than good in their ESG timing. However, NetApp alsocould have beaten them to the punch if we hadn’t still been working onassumptions that remained unchallenged even after the disruptive natureof the transition in the US presidency on January 6th andRussia’s subsequent invasion of Ukraine. Both changed the entire energyand regulatory landscape. Yet, because NetApp lacked a way of lookingmore broadly at all the forces that impact our stakeholders’livelihoods, we allowed our competitors to seize the initiative.CategorisationSeveral frameworks and tools can be used to avoid these kinds of blindspots by looking at a business and the forces that surround it across arange of different categories. Methodologies, including Porter’s fiveforces, PEST, VRIO, and the MECE principle, focus on a discrete set ofcategories through which to view the problem domain, each one of whichhas its strengths and weaknesses. For the sustainability challenge, aPEST / PESTLE / STEEPLE analysis would have likely given NetApp theperspective it needed to challenge long-held assumptions or to map theimpact of disruptive change across environmental, political, andregulatory groupings. as a level of impact as shown in the followingexample from PESTEL Analysis PowerPoint - B2U -Business-to-you.comThere is nothing intrinsically necessary or authoritative about thosecategories. The PESTEL framework evolved from a simpler breakdown calledPEST and has since evolved to STEEPLE or TELOS category sets, all ofwhich are valid and all of which are arguable. Categories evolve, andeach set needs to be fit for purpose.There isn’t any “right” way to categorise the issues in a particularproblem domain, and having multiple ways of categorising them isprobably to look at the problem from different perspectives is perhapsbetter than agonising trying to find the one irrefutable truth. The“Truth” is often interconnected in strange ways, more like the messyhidden rhizome beneath a mushroom than a neat branching of trees ofknowledge and trying to impose order on it can sometimes lead toanalysis paralysis if not outright madness.What do we look for?With the right kind of categorisation, we can now ask the rightquestions. What types of things within these categories will likelyimpact us and our stakeholders? Let’s call them “watchlist items”. Inthe PESTEL diagram above, we see not only the categories but also one ormore specific areas of interest inside each category, along with a roughmeasure of the impact that will have. Using the example ofsustainability as a buying criterion, we might have identified thefollowing.      Political –                  Sanctions against Russia                    Retaliatory Sanctions vs the West                    European Energy Disruption and Rationing                    Escalation of Hybrid warfare                  Economic                  Energy Price Increases for those formerly dependent on Russianfossil fuel                    Closer ties between Russia and the developing world (BRICS)                  Technical                  Shutdown of German Nuclear Power                    Nation-state level cyber-warfare on information infrastructure                    Greater focus on measurement and reporting of energy use                  Ethical          Acceleration of transition away from Fossil Fuels      This is by no means an exhaustive list, and much of it has the benefitof hindsight, but two findings should be clear from that list.The first finding is that heightened concerns over energy infrastructureand cybersecurity could have been identified as early as February 2021.The second finding is that some of the identified watchlist items couldbelong to multiple categories. For example, is the shutdown of nuclearpower a technical, economic, or ethical issue? It could easily be arguedthat it belongs in all three and that the connections between thecategories and the watchlist items aren’t the superficial kind ofhierarchical taxonomy that we have come to depend on to structure ourknowledge since the 19th century.Suppose we want to avoid descending into fruitless arguments about whichcategory a watchlist item belongs in. In that case, our analysis toolneeds to provide a way for these to live in a kind of quantumsuperposition by simultaneously existing in many different categories.In some cases, categorisation and watchlist creation may uncover newitems of interest that don’t fit our chosen categories. This is aperfectly acceptable outcome because it allows us to start at the topwith categories and work our way down to watchlist items, or conversely,start with things we are interested in and see what categories evolvefrom that and how well we have distributed our current thinking acrossall areas of concern.This should alert us to areas of under or over-investment and potentialblind spots.##Measuring ImpactAlong with identifying the categories you use to derive insight and tohelp identify watchlist items within those categories, we need some wayof determining the relative importance or impact each one of these itemswill have. The PESTEL diagram above uses a straightforward low, medium,and high impact, which is the least granular scale you can useeffectively. At the other end of the scale are percentages or absoluterevenue measures to the nearest cent, but these measures often hide thebigger truth.Though I’m often in awe of our business planners when we announce ourearnings and our revenue projections, for many of the things we aretrying to predict, we don’t have the backing data or the experienceneeded to predict things with that level of confidence. The future can’tbe predicted to the last decimal place, and we risk only analysing whatcan be measured, which leads to a kind of McNamara fallacy. If you’venever heard of it, perhaps this quote will give you an idea of howdangerous it can be  “The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. Thesecond step is to disregard that which can’t easily be measured orgiven a quantitative value. The third step is to presume that whatcan’t be easily measured isn’t essential. The fourth step is to saythat what can’t be easily measured really doesn’t exist. This issuicide. “  DanielYankelovich,“Interpreting the New Life Styles”, SalesManagement (1971)[2]The other problem is that when granular metrics are available, it isoften difficult for people without subject matter expertise to givethose metrics adequate context. For example, if I say an email campaignresulted in a 0.3% open rate, can a non-marketing person tell me ifthat’s good or bad? Or if an analyst says that a given market hassales growth of 13%, can you say if that’s high or low growth withoutknowing how big or mature that market is?In many cases, we are dealing with systems with many “unknown unknowns,”and assigning specific growth rates, percentages, total addressablemarket sizes, or penetration figures creates a false sense of accuracy.To resolve this, we need to look at analyst methods like the GartnerHype Cycle, Wardley Maps, and Technology Diffusion curves, where we seerepeatedly five-stage or five-scale systems appear. In some cases, it’spossible to map differently named stages directly against each other.For example, the Slope of Enlightenment and the early majority are bothstage 4 on each of these fixed adoption curve analyses.This five-point scale gives us some good opportunities to harmonise andvalidly compare data from various kinds of analysis. It also provides anintuitive and easily understood way of creating quality from a set ofquantity ranges or a quantifiable metric from a purely qualitativeestimate.12345T-ShirtXSSMLXLTimescaleImmanentSoonIntermediateLaterMuch LaterQantityVery smallSmallMediumLargeVery LargeGartner Priority MatrixLowLowModerateHighTransformationalGartner Hype Cycle StageTech TriggerPeak of Inflated ExpectationsTrough of DisillusionmentSlope of enlightenmentPlateau of ProductivityGartner Time to PlateauTime to Plateau &amp;lt; 2 YearsTime to Plateau 2 - 5 YearsTime to Plateau 5 - 10 YearsTime to Plateau &amp;gt;10 YearsObsolete before plateauMarket growth1% or less1 - 5%6% - 10%10 - 20%20% or moreAnalyst RatingsStrong SellSellHoldBuyStrong BuyInnovation DiffusionInnovatorsEarly Adopters (Pre Chasm)Early Adopters (Post Chasm)Late MajorityLaggardsPerformance TierNo guaranteeValueStandardPerformanceUltraAvailabilitytwo ninesthree ninesfour ninesfive ninessix ninesWardley StagesGenesisCustom BuiltCustom Built (2)Product / RentalCommodity + UtilityClickthrough Rates&amp;lt;0.5%0.5-2%2% - 5%5%-10%10%+Given the uncertain nature of the data, using a qualitative metric likethis keeps us mindful of its speculative nature. At the same time,explicitly recording our assumptions about what “high” or“transformative” means in our narratives keeps us honest andtransparent in using qualitative terms between ourselves and in ourmarketing and other narratives.Measuring TimeThe final element in this is the question of time and what actions weshould be taking now to prepare for the things we have identified asbeing essential to us. This is the most crucial question of all and themost challenging question to answer. Almost anyone can see that thestock market, along with sporadic booms and busts, will go up over time.If you’re patient, you can make good progress, but if you knew preciselywhat days it would be up or down with exact certainty, you could becomethe wealthiest person in the world. Being too early into the market isoften as bad as being too late. Trying to predict precisely when a giventrend will have a specific impact requires a level of information andpredictability that most futurists don’t have. As mentioned earlier, ourfinancial team’s ability to predict NetApp’s financial metrics threemonths to a year out seems nearly magic. However, even that stilldoesn’t answer the most critical question.What should I be doing about this future impact today?One of the best ways of answering this comes from McKinsey via their“Three Horizons” model.This framework isn’t new; indeed, the best explanation can be found inan article entitled Enduring Ideas: The three horizons of growth |McKinsey. It assumes that adoption follows a series of “S-curves,” whichmaps well to the technology adoption model.It also maps well to Gartner’s Transform, Grow, Run model. The things inHorizon One are well known or are dominated by “known knowns”; thebusiness depends on their existence, and the focus is to run them atscale with the greatest efficiency. On a Wardley map, this correspondsto the utility stage of development. This is the realm of superiorexecution and management excellence. At the other end of the scale isHorizon 3, where things are the least well-known, with “unknownunknowns”, and the risks of guessing wrong are high, along with therewards from making the right moves early. This is the place wherevision, enthusiasm, and evangelism thrive. It is also where leadershiphas the most significant transformational impact.In the middle is horizon 2, which takes the successful efforts of thehigh-risk horizon three efforts and confers positional advantage. Icharacterise this as the “known unknowns” stage. This is whereaggressive entrepreneurship, growth mindsets, and flexible budgets rule.As noted in the article  “Time, as noted on the x-axis, should not be interpreted as a promptfor when to pay attention—now, later, or much later. Companies mustmanage businesses along all three horizons concurrently.”Rather than trying to guess exactly when a watchlist item will create animpact, using the three horizons model focuses on what level ofinvestment is warranted and what kind of management and leadershipapproach is needed to address that item today to prepare ourselves forwhat may happen in the future.Bringing it all together – The Magic RoundaboutNow that we have all of these requirements clarified, how can we createa tool that effectively and visually pleasingly communicates all ofthese with the data we already have or can be gathered easily usingcommonly available tools with minimal need for enablement?The answer is “The Magic Roundabout”. This combines categories,watchlist items, impact scores, and McKinsey Horizons into a “Sunburst”diagram available to every user of the Microsoft Office suite ofproducts. The underlying dataset is an elementary Excel spreadsheettable that looks like this.CategoryHorizon 1Horizon 2Horizon 3ImportanceAI..AI based Inside-sales3AI.Content Creation3AIWebsite Chatbots3Cloud..Serverless + PaaS4Cloud.Containerisation3CloudLift &amp;amp; Shift3CyberSecurity..Exfiltration detection and prevention3CyberSecurity.Immutable Snapshots + Logical Airgap3CyberSecurityTraditional Backup3Sustainability..Dynamic Rebalancing to Cloud3Sustainability.Sustainability Reporting3SustainabilityHDD to Flash3Flash..PLC3Flash.QLC3FlashHigh performance flash3Which results in a diagram that looks like thisHowever, a more complex example shows how this can be extended oradapted to accommodate some of the requirements that were brought upearlier, including the need for a watchlist item to belong to multiplecategories. It also provides for things not previously addressed, suchas tracking technology that is currently on horizon one but evolvingrapidly due to changes and technical disruptions.While the radial nature of the sunburst diagram clearly shows the trendand horizons and, based on early prototyping, is the most visuallyappealing way of representing our data, like a Mercator projection, itdoes tend to distort the relative importance of watchlist items towardsthe edges of the map. This can be addressed by using the complementarytreemap diagram, which uses exactly the same dataset.This is clearer to read and preserves the relative overall importance atthe expense of navigating the trends over time."

    "content": "Visualising the Future with the Magic Roundabout™ SchematicIntroductionPredicting future outcomes is crucial in the ever-evolving landscape oftechnology and market trends. Traditional models often fail to providepredictive value, especially during rapid change. The Magic Roundabout™schematic is designed to address this need by providing a comprehensivevisual tool for analysing and predicting technology and market trends.The ChallengeCreating accurate models to predict technology and market trends isinherently difficult, mainly when trends are in a state of flux. Leadersneed tools that offer insights into hidden patterns and biases, enablingthem to make informed decisions and motivate action.Existing ToolsWhile traditional tools like SWOT analysis and the Gartner Hype Cycleare helpful, they often reinforce existing biases and fail to provide abroad perspective. The Magic Roundabout schematic overcomes theselimitations by integrating multiple analytical frameworks.A New PerspectiveThe Magic Roundabout™ schematic was developed to help organisationsrecognise and adapt to significant technical and market shifts, such asthe growing importance of sustainability in IT purchase decisions. Byenabling the analysis of various factors that might not be typicallyincluded in a tech trend or market analysis, including political,economic, and ethical dimensions, this tool helps identify and addresscognitive biases, blind spots, and where marketing rhetoric isdisconnected from business development and market priorities.Categorization and Watchlist ItemsThe schematic uses a range of categories to analyse the forces impactinga business. Methodologies such as Porter’s Five Forces, PEST, and theMECE principle can all be integrated to provide a holistic view. Forexample, a PESTLE analysis can reveal the impact of disruptive changesacross different categories, helping organisations like NetApp tochallenge long-held assumptions.Unlike other two-dimensional systems of visualising data, eachidentified trend (watchlist item) can be a member of multiplecategories, each having a level of impact or horizon unique to thatcategory. This allows for a multi-dimensional analysis of the data whilestill preserving a simple and visually appealing representation of thedataset that can be constructed with widely available toolsets such asMicrosoft Excel.Measuring ImpactTo assess the relative importance of different factors, the constructionof the Magic Roundabout schematic allows for the use of any quantitativescale, including hard financial data or other well-understood metricsapplicable across the problem domain or source dataset. In the absenceof an objective metric, we recommend a five-point scale to measureopinions relating to impact or importance. This qualitative metricensures that speculative data is treated with appropriate caution whilemaintaining transparency in assumptions.The five-point scale could be structured as follows:      Very Low Impact        Low Impact        Medium Impact        High Impact        Very High Impact  This approach can harmonise data from existing analyst reports,providing an intuitive and easily understood way of creating qualityfrom a set of quantity ranges or a quantifiable metric from a purelyqualitative estimate. This qualitative metric ensures that speculativedata is treated with appropriate caution while maintaining transparencyin assumptions.Time HorizonsPredicting time to impact or exactly when a technology is likely to beimpactful is at best uncertain with the negative consequences of beingtoo early to market being as great, if not greater than being late,which at least has the potential advantage of leveraging the fastfollower model. Trends also tend to follow an s-curve adoption whichmakes adoption and time impact at an organisational and market subsethighly dependent on the ability to adapt to change.As a result, the schematic also incorporates McKinsey’s Three Horizonsmodel to determine the level of investment and management approachneeded for different trends.Rather than focusing on timelines, the McKinsey model helpsorganizations prepare for future impacts by focusing on the kinds ofleadership actions should be taken today. This horizon model also mapsneatly onto the Gartner “Transform, Grow, Run” model.To aid in identification of which horizon a given trend (watchlist item)falls into, the respondent can be asked “what do you know about thistrend”      “I have comprehensive knowledge / this is part of my core business”= “Known Knowns” = Horizon 1 / Run        “I know enough to extract significant value, but there’s stillthings I need to get a handle on” = “Known Unknowns” = Horizon 2 /Grow        “I know enough to be dangerous” = “Unknown Unknowns” = Horizon 3 /Transform  While a three horizon model provides simplicity and power, the magicroundabout could also accommodate other time based segmentation acrossmore than three categories such as Current Quarter, Current Year, Nextyear, 2+ years, 5+ years, however unless there was sufficient rigor inthe predictions against these timeframes, they could easily lead to afalse sense of security that nothing needs to be done, or that dealingwith that will be someone else’s problem by the time it becomesimportant at which point it may be too late to execute even a fastfollower strategy.The Magic Roundabout SchematicThe Magic Roundabout™ schematic combines these categories, watchlistitems, impact scores, and time horizons into a visually appealingsunburst diagram. This tool is available to every user of the MicrosoftOffice suite and can be easily adapted to various needs.Example DatasetA simplified Excel spreadsheet table is used to create the schematic:CategoryHorizon 1Horizon 2Horizon 3ImportanceAI..AI based Inside-sales3AI.Content Creation3AIWebsite Chatbots3Cloud..Serverless + PaaS4Cloud.Containerisation3CloudLift &amp;amp; Shift3CyberSecurity..Exfiltration detection and prevention3CyberSecurity.Immutable Snapshots + Logical Airgap3CyberSecurityTraditional Backup3Sustainability..Dynamic Rebalancing to Cloud3Sustainability.Sustainability Reporting3SustainabilityHDD to Flash3Flash..PLC3Flash.QLC3FlashHigh performance flash3Reweighting this data based on perceived impact from different personasor parts of an organisation, or even across different organisations canprovide a different perspective for example the dataset used above mighthave significantly different importance weightings depending ondifferent roles and personas.CategoryHorizon 1Horizon 2Horizon 3ImportanceAI..AI based Inside-sales2AI.Content Creation 4AIWebsite Chatbots  3Cloud..Serverless + PaaS2Cloud.Containerisation 1CloudLift &amp;amp; Shift  2CyberSecurity..Exfiltration detection and prevention5CyberSecurity.Immutable Snapshots + Logical Airgap 4CyberSecurityTraditional Backup  3Sustainability..Dynamic Rebalancing to Cloud2Sustainability.Sustainability Reporting 4SustainabilityHDD to Flash  2Flash..PLC2Flash.QLC 1FlashHigh performance flash  3By comparing the two graphics it becomes immediately apparent thatcybersecurity and future threats are perceived by the second persona asfar more impactful overall than cloud and consumption based economicmodels.

    "content": "title: “Welcome to Artisanal Intelligence”date: 2025-04-10author: crankbirdlayout: post—Welcome to Artisanal Intelligence  A place where technology meets intentionality, and code meets craft.Modern artificial intelligence often feels like mass production — sprawling neural networks, industrial-scale data centers, and opaque algorithms trained on oceans of data. But what if intelligence could be artisanal?🧠 What Do We Mean by “Artisanal”?The term artisanal might evoke images of sourdough bread, handmade furniture, or carefully roasted coffee. But in the context of AI, it suggests something more subtle: a human-centered, intentional approach to building and understanding intelligence.Why “Artisanal” and Not “Artificial”?  Artisanal intelligence is curated. Instead of training models on everything, we might train them on something — something meaningful, contextual, or intentionally chosen.  It values transparency. Like watching a baker knead dough, we believe in models that you can understand and even tinker with.  It’s designed for collaboration. Not to replace people, but to augment them. To partner with them. To amplify judgment, not override it.🛠️ Tools, Not Gods  “The best tools don’t make decisions for you. They help you think better.”Many modern AI systems are black boxes. Artisanal Intelligence seeks the opposite: white boxes that support clarity. We believe that design matters. That a well-structured prompt is as important as the model that reads it. That interface is part of intelligence.Here’s what that might look like in practice:1234- handcrafted_models: true- modular_components: true- human_feedback: required- corporate_buzzwords: deprecated"
