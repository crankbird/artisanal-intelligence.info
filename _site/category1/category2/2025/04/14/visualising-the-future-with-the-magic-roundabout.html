    <p><strong>Visualising the Future with the Magic Roundabout™ Schematic</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Predicting future outcomes is crucial in the ever-evolving landscape of
technology and market trends. Traditional models often fail to provide
predictive value, especially during rapid change. The Magic Roundabout™
schematic is designed to address this need by providing a comprehensive
visual tool for analysing and predicting technology and market trends.</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>

<p>Creating accurate models to predict technology and market trends is
inherently difficult, mainly when trends are in a state of flux. Leaders
need tools that offer insights into hidden patterns and biases, enabling
them to make informed decisions and motivate action.</p>

<p><strong>Existing Tools</strong></p>

<p>While traditional tools like SWOT analysis and the Gartner Hype Cycle
are helpful, they often reinforce existing biases and fail to provide a
broad perspective. The Magic Roundabout schematic overcomes these
limitations by integrating multiple analytical frameworks.</p>

<p><strong>A New Perspective</strong></p>

<p>The Magic Roundabout™ schematic was developed to help organisations
recognise and adapt to significant technical and market shifts, such as
the growing importance of sustainability in IT purchase decisions. By
enabling the analysis of various factors that might not be typically
included in a tech trend or market analysis, including political,
economic, and ethical dimensions, this tool helps identify and address
cognitive biases, blind spots, and where marketing rhetoric is
disconnected from business development and market priorities.</p>

<p><strong>Categorization and Watchlist Items</strong></p>

<p>The schematic uses a range of categories to analyse the forces impacting
a business. Methodologies such as Porter’s Five Forces, PEST, and the
MECE principle can all be integrated to provide a holistic view. For
example, a PESTLE analysis can reveal the impact of disruptive changes
across different categories, helping organisations like NetApp to
challenge long-held assumptions.</p>

<p>Unlike other two-dimensional systems of visualising data, each
identified trend (watchlist item) can be a member of multiple
categories, each having a level of impact or horizon unique to that
category. This allows for a multi-dimensional analysis of the data while
still preserving a simple and visually appealing representation of the
dataset that can be constructed with widely available toolsets such as
Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p><strong>Measuring Impact</strong></p>

<p>To assess the relative importance of different factors, the construction
of the Magic Roundabout schematic allows for the use of any quantitative
scale, including hard financial data or other well-understood metrics
applicable across the problem domain or source dataset. In the absence
of an objective metric, we recommend a five-point scale to measure
opinions relating to impact or importance. This qualitative metric
ensures that speculative data is treated with appropriate caution while
maintaining transparency in assumptions.</p>

<p>The five-point scale could be structured as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Very Low Impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low Impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medium Impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High Impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very High Impact</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This approach can harmonise data from existing analyst reports,
providing an intuitive and easily understood way of creating quality
from a set of quantity ranges or a quantifiable metric from a purely
qualitative estimate. This qualitative metric ensures that speculative
data is treated with appropriate caution while maintaining transparency
in assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>Time Horizons</strong></p>

<p>Predicting time to impact or exactly when a technology is likely to be
impactful is at best uncertain with the negative consequences of being
too early to market being as great, if not greater than being late,
which at least has the potential advantage of leveraging the fast
follower model. Trends also tend to follow an s-curve adoption which
makes adoption and time impact at an organisational and market subset
highly dependent on the ability to adapt to change.</p>

2013" /></p>

<p>As a result, the schematic also incorporates McKinsey’s Three Horizons
model to determine the level of investment and management approach
needed for different trends.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future-with-the-magic-roundabout/media/media/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Rather than focusing on timelines, the McKinsey model helps
organizations prepare for future impacts by focusing on the kinds of
leadership actions should be taken today. This horizon model also maps
neatly onto the Gartner “Transform, Grow, Run” model.</p>

<p>To aid in identification of which horizon a given trend (watchlist item)
falls into, the respondent can be asked “what do you know about this
trend”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“I have comprehensive knowledge / this is part of my core business”
= “Known Knowns” = Horizon 1 / Run</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“I know enough to extract significant value, but there’s still
things I need to get a handle on” = “Known Unknowns” = Horizon 2 /
Grow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“I know enough to be dangerous” = “Unknown Unknowns” = Horizon 3 /
Transform</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While a three horizon model provides simplicity and power, the magic
roundabout could also accommodate other time based segmentation across
more than three categories such as Current Quarter, Current Year, Next
year, 2+ years, 5+ years, however unless there was sufficient rigor in
the predictions against these timeframes, they could easily lead to a
false sense of security that nothing needs to be done, or that dealing
with that will be someone else’s problem by the time it becomes
important at which point it may be too late to execute even a fast
follower strategy.</p>

<p><strong>The Magic Roundabout Schematic</strong></p>

<p>The Magic Roundabout™ schematic combines these categories, watchlist
items, impact scores, and time horizons into a visually appealing
sunburst diagram. This tool is available to every user of the Microsoft
Office suite and can be easily adapted to various needs.</p>

<p><strong>Example Dataset</strong></p>

<p>A simplified Excel spreadsheet table is used to create the schematic:</p>

<p>Reweighting this data based on perceived impact from different personas
or parts of an organisation, or even across different organisations can
provide a different perspective for example the dataset used above might
have significantly different importance weightings depending on
different roles and personas.</p>

<p>By comparing the two graphics it becomes immediately apparent that
cybersecurity and future threats are perceived by the second persona as
far more impactful overall than cloud and consumption based economic
models. By averaging these scores across different personas, companies
and market segments, trends can be identified that differ across
geographies and job roles, allowing for a more tailored go-to-market
response.</p>

<p>This methodology has also been used with more objective information to
perform an analysis of total addressable market categorised by NetApp’s
go to market priorities which surfaced up some unexpected insights as
seen in the following graphic.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/visualising-the-future-with-the-magic-roundabout/media/media/image6.emf" alt="" /></p>

<p>The resulting diagrams provides a clear visualization of trends and
their relative importance, helping organizations navigate the
complexities of market dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The Magic Roundabout™ schematic is a powerful tool for business
consulting in the field of technology. By offering a comprehensive,
visual method for analyzing market trends, it enables better
decision-making and strategic planning.</p>
