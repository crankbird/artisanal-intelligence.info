## 🧭 What This Post Covers

This is a *fully featured sample post* to help you test:

- Rendering of headers and lists
- Syntax highlighting in code blocks
- Embedded tables and blockquotes
- Images and inline metadata usage
- Horizontal rules and callouts
- Frontmatter parsing in layout

## 🧠 Why This Matters

> “A well-structured test post tells you more about your theme than ten broken layouts.”

Most blog engines work fine for minimal content. But as your blog matures, you’ll want:

- Good typography for longer reads
- Semantic support for content like tutorials
- A flexible layout that works for both casual and technical audiences

This post helps you simulate that real-world complexity — without resorting to lorem ipsum.

## 🔧 Sample Code Snippet

Here’s a simple Python function using syntax highlighting:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}. Welcome to Artisanal Intelligence.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("crankbird")
```
