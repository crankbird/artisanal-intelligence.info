# Welcome to *Artisanal Intelligence*

> A place where technology meets intentionality, and code meets craft.

Modern artificial intelligence often feels like mass production — sprawling neural networks, industrial-scale data centers, and opaque algorithms trained on oceans of data. But *what if intelligence could be artisanal*?

## 🧠 What Do We Mean by “Artisanal”?

The term *artisanal* might evoke images of sourdough bread, handmade furniture, or carefully roasted coffee. But in the context of AI, it suggests something more subtle: **a human-centered, intentional approach to building and understanding intelligence.**

### Why “Artisanal” and Not “Artificial”?

- **Artisanal intelligence is curated.** Instead of training models on everything, we might train them on *something* — something meaningful, contextual, or intentionally chosen.
- **It values transparency.** Like watching a baker knead dough, we believe in models that you can understand and even *tinker with*.
- **It’s designed for collaboration.** Not to replace people, but to augment them. To partner with them. To amplify judgment, not override it.

## 🛠️ Tools, Not Gods

> “The best tools don’t make decisions for you. They help you think better.”

Many modern AI systems are black boxes. Artisanal Intelligence seeks the opposite: **white boxes that support clarity.** We believe that design matters. That a well-structured prompt is as important as the model that reads it. That *interface is part of intelligence*.

Here's what that might look like in practice:

```yaml
- handcrafted_models: true
- modular_components: true
- human_feedback: required
- corporate_buzzwords: deprecated
```
